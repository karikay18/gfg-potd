### 17. All Unique Permutations of an array

### My Approach
- Sort the array in ascending order.
- Generate all unique permutations using `std::next_permutation`.
- Return the vector of unique permutations.

### Time and Auxiliary Space Complexity

- **Time Complexity:** `O(N! * N)`, where N is the length of the array. This is because there are N! permutations, and for each permutation, it takes O(N) time to copy it.
- **Auxiliary Space Complexity:** `O(N!)`, where N is the length of the array. This is the space needed to store all unique permutations.

### Code (C++)

```cpp
class Solution {
  public:
    vector<vector<int>> uniquePerms(vector<int> &arr, int n) {
        sort(arr.begin(), arr.end());

        vector<vector<int>> out;
        do {
            out.push_back(arr);
        } while (next_permutation(arr.begin(), arr.end()));

        return out;
    }
};
```
