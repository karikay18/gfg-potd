### My Approach

To solve this problem, I followed the subsequent steps:

1. Traverse the binary tree in a recursive manner.
2. For each node, calculate the number of candies needed to distribute equally among its left and right subtrees.
3. Accumulate the total moves required during the traversal.

### Time and Auxiliary Space Complexity

- **Time Complexity**: The time complexity of this solution is `O(N)`, where N is the number of nodes in the binary tree. This is because we visit each node once.
- **Auxiliary Space Complexity**: The auxiliary space complexity is `O(H)`, where H is the height of the binary tree. This accounts for the recursive call stack.

### Code (C++)

```cpp
class Solution
{
public:
    int solve(Node* root, int& moves)
    {
        if (!root)
        {
            return 0;
        }

        int left = solve(root->left, moves);
        int right = solve(root->right, moves);
        moves += abs(left) + abs(right);

        return root->key - 1 + left + right;
    }
    int distributeCandy(Node* root)
    {
        int moves = 0;
        solve(root, moves);
        return moves;
    }
};
```
