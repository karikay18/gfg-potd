## 21. Reverse Coding

The problem can be found at the following link: [Question Link](https://practice.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/reverse-coding2452/1)

### My Approach

To solve this problem, I have used a simple approach based on the formula for the sum of natural numbers.

- The formula `(n*(n+1))/2` gives the sum of the first `n` natural numbers.
- In the given code, I calculate the sum using this formula and return the result.

### Time and Auxiliary Space Complexity

- **Time Complexity**: `O(1)` since the calculation of the sum of natural numbers can be done in constant time.
- **Auxiliary Space Complexity**: `O(1)` as there is no extra space used that scales with the input.

### Code (C++)

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int mod = 1e9 + 7;
    int sumOfNaturals(int n) {
        long long sum = n;
        sum = (sum * (sum + 1)) % mod;
        sum /= 2;
        
        return sum;
    }
};
```
