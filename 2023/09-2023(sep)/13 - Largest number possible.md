## 13. Largest number possible

The problem can be found at the following link: [Question Link](https://practice.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/largest-number-possible5028/1)

### My Approach

To find the largest number possible with `N `digits and a given sum `S`, I followed these steps:

- Check if it's impossible to create a number with the given N and S. 
	- If S is zero and N is greater than 1 or if the maximum possible sum of N single-digit numbers (9*N) is less than S, return "-1" because it's impossible.
- Initialize an empty string `out` to store the result.
- Loop N times to construct the number:
    - If S is greater than or equal to 9, add '9' to the `out` string and subtract 9 from S.
    - Otherwise, if S is not zero, add the remaining value of S as a string to the `out` string and set S to 0.
    - If S is zero, add '0' to the `out` string to fill the remaining digits.
- Return the `out` string as the largest number possible.

### Time and Auxiliary Space Complexity

- **Time Complexity**: The algorithm runs in `O(N)` time because we iterate through the digits once.
- **Auxiliary Space Complexity**: The space complexity is `O(N)` because we store the result in the `out` string, which can have a maximum of `N` digits.

### Code (C++)

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    string findLargest(int N, int S) {
        if ((!S && N > 1) || N * 9 < S) {
            return "-1";
        }
        string out;
        for (int i = 0; i < N; ++i) {
            if (S >= 9) {
                out += '9';
                S -= 9;
            } else {
                if (S) {
                    out += to_string(S);
                    S = 0;
                } else {
                    out += '0';
                }
            }
        }
        return out;
    }
};
```
