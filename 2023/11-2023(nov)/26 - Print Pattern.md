### My Approach
To make this pattern, I followed a recursive technique with backtracking.
- I kept reducing N by 5 in a loop until it got to 0 or less.
- While doing this, I added the current N value to the output vector twice. Once before making the recursive call and once after.
- The pattern comes from the sequence of values added to the vector.

### Time and Auxiliary Space Complexity

- **Time Complexity**: `O(N)`, where `N` is the input integer.
- **Auxiliary Space Complexity**: `O(N)`, as we store the pattern in a vector.

### Code (C++)
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    void solve(int n, vector<int>& out) {
        out.push_back(n);
        if (n <= 0)
            return;
        solve(n - 5, out);
        out.push_back(n);
    }

    vector<int> pattern(int N) {
        vector<int> out;
        solve(N, out);
        return out;
    }
};
```
