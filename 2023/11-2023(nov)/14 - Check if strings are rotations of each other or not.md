### My Approach
To check if two strings, `s1` and `s2`, are rotations of each other, 
- I concatenate `s1` with itself to create a new string `s`. 
- Then, I check if `s2` is a substring of `s` using the `find` function. If the index is not -1, then `s2` is a rotation of `s1`.

### Time and Auxiliary Space Complexity

- **Time Complexity**: `O(N)`, where `N` is the length of `s1`.
- **Auxiliary Space Complexity**: `O(N)`, as we create a new string by concatenation.

### Code (C++)
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    bool areRotations(string s1, string s2) {
        string s = s1 + s1;
        return s.find(s2) != -1;
    }
};
```
