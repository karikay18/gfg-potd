## 06. String Permutations

The problem can be found at the following link: [Question Link](https://practice.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/permutations-of-a-given-string-1587115620/1)

### My Approach

To find all the permutations of a given string `s`, we can use a backtracking approach. 
- The idea is to swap characters at different positions and recursively generate all possible permutations. 
- We start with the first character `s[0]` and swap it with every other character in the string. Then, we recursively find all permutations of the remaining characters. 
- After generating all permutations, we sort the result vector to ensure the output is in lexicographically sorted order.

### Time and Auxiliary Space Complexity

- **Time Complexity**: `O(N!)`, where `N` is the length of the input string `s`. This is because there are `N!` permutations possible for a string of length `N`.
- **Auxiliary Space Complexity**: `O(N!)` because the `out` array will store all the permutations,

### Code (C++)

```cpp
class Solution{
public:
    vector<string> out;

    void check(string &s, int i, int &n){
        if(i == n){
            out.push_back(s);
            return; 
        }
        
        for(int j = i; j < n; ++j){
            swap(s[i], s[j]);
            check(s, i+1, n); 
            swap(s[i], s[j]); 
        }
    }
  
    vector<string> permutation(string s){
        int n = s.size(); 
        check(s, 0, n); 
        sort(out.begin(), out.end());
        return out; 
    }
};
```
