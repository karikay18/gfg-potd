### My Approach
- Calculate the bitwise XOR of `m` and `n` to find the bits that are different.
- Find the rightmost set bit in the XOR result using the expression `res = res & (-res)`.
- Return the position (1-based) of the rightmost set bit.

### Time and Auxiliary Space Complexity

- **Time Complexity**: O(1)
- **Auxiliary Space Complexity**: O(1)

### Code (C++)
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int posOfRightMostDiffBit(int m, int n) {
        if (m == n)
            return -1;
            
        int res = m ^ n;
        res = res & (-res);
        return log2(res) + 1;
    }
};
```
