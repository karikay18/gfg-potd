## 23. Count More than n/k Occurrences

### My Approach
To solve this problem, I use a `map` to store the frequency of each element. I then iterate through the map and count the elements that occur more than `n/k` times.

### Time and Auxiliary Space Complexity

- **Time Complexity** : O(n), where n is the size of the array.
- **Auxiliary Space Complexity** : O(n), for the map.

### Code (C++)
```cpp
class Solution
{
    public:
    int countOccurence(int arr[], int n, int k) {
        map<int,int> mp;
        int minCnt = n/k;
        for(int i = 0 ; i < n; ++i)
            ++mp[arr[i]];
        
        int out = 0;
        for(auto i: mp)
            if(i.second > minCnt)
                ++out;
                
        return out;
    }
};
```
