### My Approach
Simply greddy approach, I start by sorting the array. Then, for each element, I consider two possibilities:
- Getting max after adding `k` to the current element and subtracting `k` from the maximum element.
- Getting min after subtracting `k` from the current element and adding `k` to the minimum element.
I update the minimum difference (`out`) by comparing it with the difference obtained from the above two possibilities.

### Time and Auxiliary Space Complexity

- **Time Complexity**: `O(nlog n)` for sorting `arr` array.
- **Auxiliary Space Complexity**: `O(1)`, as no extra space is used.


### Code (C++)
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int getMinDiff(int arr[], int n, int k) {
        sort(arr, arr + n);
        int out = arr[n - 1] - arr[0];

        for (int i = 0; i < n - 1; ++i) {
            if (arr[i + 1] - k >= 0) {
                int nax = max(arr[i] + k, arr[n - 1] - k);
                int nin = min(arr[i + 1] - k, arr[0] + k);
                out = min(out, nax - nin);
            }
        }
        return out;
    }
};
```
